License

The following terms are defined as follows:

1. Definitions

   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
      other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
      derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
      literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
      cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
      be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
      derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
      Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
      this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
      work, performance, or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
      timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered
      an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, or
      scientific or artistic works, or of works other than literary,
      artistic, or scientific works, which are assembled in an
      intellectual creation, including in particular a work of art or
      literature.
   c. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
      that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
   d. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
      the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
      or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and
      in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
      musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver,
      declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or
      artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a
      phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first
      fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the
      case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
   e. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
      terms of this License including without limitation any production in
      the literary, scientific and artistic domain, or other domain.

2. License Grant

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
   grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
   irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Work.

3. Attribution

   You must, unless it is not reasonably practicable, keep intact all
   copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or
   means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
   pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original
   Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
   a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in
   Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
   means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
   supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
   Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
   Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
   licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b),
   in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work
   in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Bouncing Bat Studios," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Bouncing Bat Studios").
   The credit required by this Section 3(a) may be implemented in any
   reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
   Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
   credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
   appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as
   prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
   avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
   Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
   by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
   explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
   endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
   Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the
   separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
   Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
